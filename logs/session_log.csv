The cost of hiring a lawyer in India depends on various factors, including:

4. Complexity of the matter: Cases that require extensive research, documentation, or negotiations may cost more than simpler cases.

On average, lawyers in India charge:

* For moderate complexity cases (e.g., property disputes): ₹50,000 to ₹200,000 (approximately $667-$2,667 USD)

A: I'd be happy to help simplify the legal text from the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 for you.

The main idea is that when we're trying to figure out what happened (called ""facts"" in law), we want to consider all the relevant information. This means looking at things that are closely related to the issue we're trying to resolve, like a puzzle piece that fits together with other pieces.

Here are some key points:

1. **Relevant facts**: We can look at facts that are directly connected to what's being disputed (called ""facts in issue""). These might be things that happened before, during, or after the main event.
2. **Transactions and connections**: If something is part of a bigger story or transaction, it can be relevant even if it didn't happen exactly when we're looking at.
3. **Motives and actions**: What people were thinking or planning (their ""state of mind"") or what they did before or after the main event can be important to consider.
4. **Explaining or introducing facts**: Sometimes, we need to look at things that happened earlier or later to understand what really went down.
5. **Conspiracies and agreements**: If people were working together on something (called a ""conspiracy""), what they said or did can be relevant too.

In short, the goal is to gather all the important details that help us figure out what actually happened."

==========================

### Relevancy of Certain Evidence
#### Relevant Facts
* A statement by a deceased person, made in the ordinary course of business, is relevant if it refers to a matter into which the Court has to inquire.
* An entry in any public or official book, register, or record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, is itself a relevant fact.

### Relevancy of Statements
#### Under Special Circumstances
* Entries in books of account, regularly kept in the course of business, are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to inquire.
* A statement by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by law, is itself a relevant fact.

### Judgments and Orders
#### Previous Judgments Relevant
* A final judgment, order, or decree of a competent Court, which confers upon or takes away from any person any legal character, is relevant when the existence of such legal character is relevant.
* Such judgment, order, or decree is conclusive proof that any legal character it confers accrued at the time when it came into operation.

#### Judgments and Orders Not Conclusive
* Judgments, orders, or decrees other than those mentioned in sections 40, 41, and 42 are irrelevant unless the existence of such judgment, order, or decree is a fact in issue.
* Such judgments, orders, or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state."

**Presumptions**

1. **89. Presumption as to due execution, etc., of documents not produced**: The court assumes that any document requested but not produced was executed and attested correctly.
2. **90. Presumption as to documents thirty years old**: If a document is at least 30 years old, the court assumes it was written and published by the person claiming authorship.
3. **87. Presumption as to books, maps and charts**: The court assumes that any book, map, or chart produced in evidence was written and published by the person claiming authorship.

2. **90A. Presumption as to electronic records five years old**: If an electronic record is at least 5 years old, the court assumes it was created and stored correctly.

2025-07-11T01:52:10.466770,uploaded,clause_breakdown,"Based on the provided context information, I will break down the legal document into individual clauses and provide a clear explanation for each one:

**Clause 21**
Oral admissions as to contents of documents are not relevant unless:
1. The party proposing to prove them shows that they are entitled to give secondary evidence of the contents under the rules contained herein.
2. Or, unless the genuineness of the document produced is in question.

This clause establishes the conditions under which oral admissions regarding the contents of a document can be considered relevant. In essence, it requires the party seeking to prove the admission to demonstrate their entitlement to provide secondary evidence or that the genuineness of the document is being questioned.

**Clause 22**
Oral admissions as to contents of electronic records are not relevant unless:
1. The genuineness of the electronic record produced is in question.

This clause applies the same principles as Clause 21, but specifically addresses oral admissions regarding electronic records.

**Clause 23**
Admissions in civil cases when relevant
In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it was made either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given or under circumstances from which the Court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.

This clause outlines the rules governing admissions in civil cases. It states that an admission will only be considered relevant if it was not made with the understanding that it would not be used as evidence, and there is no inference or agreement between the parties to keep the admission confidential.

**Clause 24**
Confession caused by inducement, threat, or promise when irrelevant in criminal proceedings
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat, or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

This clause outlines the circumstances under which a confession made by an accused person will be considered irrelevant in criminal proceedings. It states that if the confession was caused by inducement, threat, or promise related to the charge, and was made by someone with authority, then the confession is not admissible as evidence.

**Clause 25**
Confession to police-officer not to be proved
No confession made to a police-officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.

This clause prohibits the admission of confessions made to police officers as evidence in criminal proceedings.

**Clause 26**
Confession by accused while in custody of police not to be proved against him
No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police-officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.

This clause prohibits the admission of confessions made by an accused person while they are in police custody, unless the confession was made in the presence of a Magistrate.

**Clause 27**
How much information received from accused may be proved

(This clause is not applicable to the given context and will not be explained further.)

2025-07-11T01:52:58.836405,uploaded,simplified,"Here's a rewritten version of the legal document in extremely simple, everyday language:

**Evidence That Can Be Used in Court**

When deciding what happened or what someone did, we need to look at all the facts. Sometimes, people give us information or make statements that can help us figure things out.

These statements are important because they might tell us something about what really happened. Here are some examples of when these kinds of statements are important:

* If someone died and left behind a note or document that says something important.
* If someone said something in the past that is relevant to what's happening now.
* If there was an official record kept by someone doing their job, like a government worker.

We can also use maps, charts, and plans to figure things out. These are special kinds of documents that show us where things are or how they work.

**Being Careful with Questions**

When we're trying to decide what happened, we need to make sure we ask good questions. We shouldn't ask someone something just because we want to annoy them or insult them.

We also should only ask questions if we have a good reason for thinking that the answer will be important. If someone says something and then tries to deny it, we can't use evidence to contradict what they said unless there's a really good reason for it.

**Exceptions**

There are some special cases where we might need to use evidence to contradict what someone said:

* If someone is accused of doing something wrong and they say they didn't do it. We might find out later that they actually did do it.
* If someone is supposed to be impartial or fair, but they're not.

These exceptions are important because they help us make sure justice is served."

2025-07-11T03:21:15.654784,uploaded,comparison,"**Comparison of Legal Documents**

The two legal documents provided are the **Indian Evidence Act, 1872** (IEA) and the **Code of Civil Procedure, 1908** (CCP). This comparison highlights key similarities and differences in clauses, mismatched obligations or terms, and variations in parties, durations, dispute resolution, liabilities, etc.

**Similarities:**

• Both documents deal with legal procedures and evidence.
• They share a common goal of establishing the truth and determining the outcome of a case.
• Both documents provide guidelines for courts to follow when considering evidence and making decisions.

**Differences:**

**1. Purpose**

* Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA): To establish the rules governing the admissibility and weight of evidence in court proceedings.
* Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CCP): To regulate the procedure for conducting civil cases in courts.

**2. Scope**

* IEA: Applies to all types of court proceedings, including criminal and civil cases.
* CCP: Primarily applies to civil cases, with some provisions also applicable to criminal cases.

**3. Relevancy of Evidence**

* IEA: Defines relevant evidence as that which tends to prove or disprove a fact in issue (Section 4).
* CCP: Does not provide a specific definition of relevance but outlines the types of evidence that may be considered relevant (Order XIV, Rule 1).

**4. Burden of Proof**

* IEA: Places the burden of proving a fact on the party asserting it (Section 101).
* CCP: Also places the burden on the party asserting the fact, with some exceptions (Order XIX, Rule 2).

**5. Dispute Resolution**

* IEA: Does not provide specific guidelines for dispute resolution.
* CCP: Outlines procedures for settling disputes, including mediation and arbitration (Order XXI, Rule 1-3).

**6. Liability**

* IEA: Does not address liability directly but provides rules governing the admissibility of evidence.
* CCP: Regulates liability through provisions related to damages, costs, and interest (Order XXVII, Rule 1-5).

In summary, while both documents share some similarities in their purpose and scope, they differ significantly in their specific provisions and application. The IEA focuses on the rules governing evidence, whereas the CCP regulates the procedure for conducting civil cases."

	+ Obtaining the witness's presence would cause an unreasonable amount of delay or expense

### Specific Types of Evidence

#### Statements Made Under Special Circumstances

* Entries in books of account, regularly kept in the course of business, are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to inquire
* An entry in any public or official book, register, or record stating a fact in issue or relevant fact is itself a relevant fact

#### Maps, Charts, and Plans

* Statements of facts in issue or relevant facts made in published maps or charts are themselves relevant facts

#### Acts and Notifications

* Any statement of a fact of a public nature contained in any Act of Parliament or Government notification is a relevant fact

### Judgments of Courts

#### Previous Judgments

* A final judgment, order, or decree conferring or taking away legal character or declaring a person entitled to something is relevant when the existence of such character or title is relevant
* Such judgments are conclusive proof of the facts stated

#### Other Judgments

* Judgments, orders, or decrees other than those mentioned above are irrelevant unless the existence of such judgment is a fact in issue or relevant under some other provision of this Act"

**Part I: Relevancy of Facts**

* The Act defines relevant facts as those that are connected with the matter in issue.
* Relevant facts include those that form part of the same transaction, or are the occasion, cause, or effect of facts in issue.
* Motive, preparation, and previous conduct can also be considered relevant.

**Admissions**

* Admissions are statements made by a party to the proceeding or their agent, which bind them to prove the truth of those statements.
* Admissions can also be made by persons whose position must be proved against a party to the suit.

**Statements by Persons Who Cannot Be Called as Witnesses**

* Statements made by dead or absent witnesses, or those who cannot be found, are relevant if they relate to the cause of death, are made in course of business, or affect the interest of the maker.

* The Act provides rules for excluding oral evidence when a document is available and can be used to prove the matter at issue.

**Production and Effect of Evidence**

* The Act provides rules for producing and examining witnesses, including those related to examinations-in-chief, cross-examination, and re-examination.
* Leading questions are generally allowed in cross-examination, but must not be asked without reasonable grounds."

2025-07-11T04:52:32.535006,uploaded,clause_breakdown,"Based on the provided context, I'll break down the legal document into individual clauses and explain each one:

**Clause (2) of Section 32**

* A person may prove statements that would be admissible between third parties if they were dead.

This clause allows a person to introduce evidence that is typically used in cases where someone has passed away. This means that even if the person making the statement was alive, it would still be considered relevant and admissible as evidence.

**Section 22: When Oral Admissions as to Contents of Documents are Relevant**

* Oral admissions about the contents of a document are not relevant unless:
	1. The party proposing to prove them shows they are entitled to give secondary evidence under certain rules.
	2. The genuineness of the document produced is in question.

This section deals with oral statements made about documents. It states that these statements are only admissible as evidence if one of two conditions is met: either the party making the statement has a valid reason to introduce this type of evidence or the authenticity of the document itself is being questioned.

**Section 23: Admissions in Civil Cases When Relevant**

* In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it was made:
	1. Upon an express condition that evidence of it should not be given.
	2. Under circumstances where the Court can infer that the parties agreed to keep this information confidential.

This section outlines when oral or written statements (admissions) are considered relevant in civil cases. It states that these admissions are only admissible as evidence if they were made under conditions where the parties intended for them to be public knowledge or if there is a valid reason why they should not be kept secret.

**Section 24: Confession Caused by Inducement, Threat, or Promise when Irrelevant**

* A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding:
	1. If the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat, or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person.
	2. And such inducement, threat, or promise proceeds from a person in authority and is sufficient to give the accused person grounds which would appear reasonable for supposing that by making it they would gain an advantage or avoid an evil of a temporal nature.

This section deals with confessions made by someone accused of a crime. It states that these confessions are not admissible as evidence if they were coerced or influenced by external factors, such as promises or threats.

**Section 25: Confession to Police Officer not Provable**

* No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.

This section specifically prohibits the use of confessions made to police officers as evidence in criminal trials. This is intended to protect individuals from coerced or involuntary confessions.

**Section 26: Confession by Accused while in Custody not Provable**

* No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.

This section builds upon Section 25 and specifically prohibits the use of confessions made to police officers while the accused person is in their custody. This exception only applies if the confession was made in the presence of a Magistrate.

**Section 27: How much of Information received from Accused may be Proved**

* A statement of price, made by a deceased banya in the ordinary course of his business, is a relevant fact.

This section does not have a specific rule number. It states that certain types of information, such as prices quoted by a deceased individual in their regular business activities, are considered relevant facts and can be introduced as evidence.

**Part I: Relevance of Facts**

* The Act sets out the rules for determining what evidence is relevant and admissible in court.
* Relevant facts are those that tend to prove or disprove a fact in issue.

**Admissions**

* An admission is a statement by a party or their agent, or a person with an interest in the subject matter, that can be used as evidence.
* Admissions can be made by individuals or organizations and can be used to establish facts or rebut opposing testimony.

**Statements by Persons Who Cannot Be Called as Witnesses**

* Statements made by people who are dead, unable to be found, or otherwise unavailable can be used as evidence if they meet certain criteria (e.g. related to cause of death, made in course of business).

**Opinions of Third Person When Relevant**

* Opinions expressed by experts or other third parties can be used as evidence if they are relevant and reliable.
* Examples include opinions on handwriting, digital signatures, and character.

**Character When Relevant**

* Character can be used as evidence to prove conduct imputed to a person (e.g. in a civil case).
* In criminal cases, previous good character is relevant, but previous bad character is not (except in reply).

**Part II: On Proof**

* **Facts Which Need Not Be Proved**: Facts that are judicially noticeable do not need to be proved.
* **Proof of Facts by Oral Evidence**: Oral evidence must be direct and primary.

**Documentary Evidence**

**Exclusion of Oral by Documentary Evidence**

* Certain types of oral evidence are excluded when a document is produced (e.g. evidence to explain or amend an ambiguous document).

**Part III: Production and Effect of Evidence**

* **Burden of Proof**: The burden of proof lies with the party making the claim.
* **Estoppel**: Estoppel is a legal principle that can be used to bar a person from denying a fact that they have previously admitted.

**Mismatched Obligations or Terms:**

**Our Agreement**

We're making a deal where I (the Service Provider) will do some work for you (the Client). This agreement outlines what we both agree to.

**What I'll Do For You**

I'll build a custom computer program that meets your specific requirements. After it's finished, I'll help keep it running smoothly and make sure it stays updated for one year. I'll also teach your team how to use the program.

This work will start on August 1, 2025, and continue until it's done or we decide to stop working together.

You agree to pay me a total of $50,000 in three payments:

* $20,000 when we sign this agreement
* $15,000 after I show you a first version of the program
* $15,000 after the whole project is finished

**Late Payments**

If you don't pay on time, there will be an extra fee of 1.5% per month.

**Can We End This Agreement?**

Either one of us can stop working together with 30 days' notice. If we do, you'll still owe me for the work I've done up to that point. If you're late on your payments, I might have to temporarily stop working on the project until you catch up.

**If We Disagree**

If we don't see eye-to-eye, we'll try to settle our differences through a mediation process in California. If that doesn't work, we'll go to binding arbitration according to American Arbitration Association rules.

That's it! Let me know if you have any questions."
