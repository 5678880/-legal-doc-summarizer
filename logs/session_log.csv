A: A non-technical question!

Section 377 is a part of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deals with sexual offenses. Specifically, Section 377 criminalizes ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" and applies to consensual same-sex relationships between adults.

In 2018, India's Supreme Court struck down Section 377 as unconstitutional, effectively decriminalizing homosexuality in the country."

Section 378 is also a part of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that deals with theft. Specifically, Section 378 defines ""theft"" as an act of taking someone else's property without their consent and with the intention to permanently deprive them of it.
